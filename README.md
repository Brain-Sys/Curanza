# Welcome to Curanza
Curanza is a lightweight library useful to create powerful Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications for Windows 10.
Using Curanza you can successfully apply MVVM pattern to your applications.

# Purposes
The main purpose of Curanza is to simplify the development of a UWP app for any supported platform.
Today a modern app is developed using MVVM pattern, and Curanza helps you to successfully apply this pattern.
Using Curanza, for example, you can bind a RelayCommand (and optionally his parameter) to most typical gesture/events
performed by the user on the UI.

You can open this solution with any edition of Visual Studio 2015. Inside you will find two projects: the Curanza library and a sample Universal Windows app to test the capability of Curanza.

# Dependencies
Curanza is built on top of MVVM Light Toolkit developed by Laurent Bugnion.

You can get more information about MVVM Light Toolkit at the following url:

When you get Curanza from NuGet, you automatically download MVVM Light Toolkit.
No worries about that!
